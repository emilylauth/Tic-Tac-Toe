# React Tic Tac Toe

"This week, youâ€™ll build a Tic-Tac-Toe game with React. Through this exercise, you'll practice synchronizing state between parent and child components so the board can keep track of each square in the game and each square can keep track of whose turn it is."
## Installation

- Fork the project onto your local machine

- Install a local server onto your machine

- Run the local server by entering http-server -c-1 into your terminal

## Roadmap

I may want to make style changes in the future to make it mimic a more minimalist, traditional tic-tac-toe board. I would also like to either implement a "reset board" button, or have a "clear board" button that appears after a winner is declared.

Addition: I would also like to highlight the row of the winner at the end of the game to call attention to it and subsequently the end of the game.
